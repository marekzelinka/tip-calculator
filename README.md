# Tip calculator

This project is a simple tip calculator web app. It's written in JavaScript and [React.js](https://react.dev/). I've deployed this project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Get started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/marekzelinka/tip-calculator.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the application in dev mode:

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Visit [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

## Goals

I wanted to practice using React with form inputs.
